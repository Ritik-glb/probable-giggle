              <h1> Are you guys confused about which sector to invest in ?<br> -By Keshina Goyal</h1>
          </p>
        <p>
            <h2> to the ongoing pandemic in the entire world the major four industries booming are:</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>1. Pharmaceutical industries</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
        With the virus prevailing there is an enormous demand for sanitisers, cleaners etc which
        makes this industry booming currently in this situation. Also, people are full of hope with
        the pharmaceutical industry to come up with the vaccine to fight against the CORONA
        virus.
        <p>
            <h2>2. Telecommunication industries</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            Internet had always had a robust demand. But due to the widespread virus around internet
            use is reaching new heights. Today, even teachers from every school are teaching online
            and work from home trend have increased internet demand due to which the telecom
            industry is booming.
        </p>   
        <p>
            <h2>3. Chemicals industries</h2>
        </p> 

        <p> the rise in demand for sanitisers there comes the rise in demand for chemicals used
            as inputs for the manufacturing of the same and hence making this industry flourish even
            during this epidemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            <h2>4. Textile industries</h2>
        </p>
        <p>
            There is a very high demand for PPE kits (which includes face masks, gloves,
            coveralls,etc) which makes only a specific type of clothâ€™s demand very large but still a very
            profitable sector right now.
            According to me, one should keep these sectors in mind while making your portfolio this
            year.
