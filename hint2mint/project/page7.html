           <h1> Nifty or National Index Fifty<br>
            The flagship index on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. (NSE) - By Keshina Goyal</h1></p>
        <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>
        <p>
            Nifty includes 50 largest and most liquid companies out of approximately 1600 companies
            traded on NSE, captures approximately 65% of its float-adjusted market capitalization and
            is a true reflection of the Indian stock market. Nifty is thus a highly diversified portfolio
            covering companies across 12 sectors.
        </p>
        <p><h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2></p>
        <p>1. The company should be listed and traded at NSE in India.</p>
        <p>
            2. All common shares, with a trading frequency of 100% in the last six
            months,listed on the NSE except that which provides fixed return are eligible for the
            inclusion in the NIFTY 50 index. The securites must be available for trading in NSEâ€™s
            Futures & options segment.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. Equity securities with Differential Voting Rights (DVR) are eligible for inclusion if
            and only if certain criteria is met.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. The security should have traded at an average impact cost* of 0.50% or less
            during the last six months, for 90% of the observations for portfolio of Rs. 2 crores.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Companies eligible for inclusion in the NIFTY 50 must have at least twice the
            float-adjusted market capitalization of the current smallest index constituent.
        </p>
        <p><h2>Index Construction and Compution</h2></p>
        <p>The NIFTY 50 is computed using a float-adjusted, market capitalization weighted
            methodology, wherein the level of the index reflects the total market value of all the stocks
            in the index relative to a particular base period (i.e. 1995) with the base value of 1000 and
            a base capital of Rs. 2.06 trillion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Nifty50 = (Summation of free flow market capital of 50 most liquid stocks) X (Index factor)
            Where, Free Float Market capital= (Shares outstanding for general public) X Price<br><br>
            Index Factor = Base Index value/ Market capital value in 1995.
        </p>
        <p>
            #The index is reconstituted semi-annually considering 6 months data ending January and
            July respectively to a maximum limits of 10% of the index size. Additional index
            reconstitution may be undertaken in case any of the index constituent undergoes a
            scheme of arrangement for corporate events such as merger, spin-off, compulsory
            delisting or suspension etc.
        </p>
        <p>
        *Impact cost is the cost of executing a transaction in a security in proportion to its index
        weight, measured by market capitalization at any point in time.
